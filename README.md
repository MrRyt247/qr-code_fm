## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components]("https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit") - For css fonts

### What I learned

- I learnt how to add the webpage's icon in the head.

```html
<head>
  <link
    rel="icon"
    type="image/png"
    sizes="32x32"
    href="./images/favicon-32x32.png"
  />
</head>
```

- I learnt how to import a font and apply it in css.

### Continued development

I want to focus on working on the contents in the head tag, especially importing fonts, scripts and others.
